    <h1>AFS3 Standardization Group</h1>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The AFS3 Standardization Group defines network protocols and other
    standards related to the AFS3 protocol family.  We have operated under
    a <a href="docs/draft-wilkinson-afs3-standardisation-00.html">
      Provisional Charter</a> by community consensus since August 3, 2010.
    Our work is done primarily on the
    <a href="http://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization">
      afs3-standardization mailing list</a>.  Participation is open to all
    interested parties.</p>

    <p>Current chairs are:<ul>
      <li>Jeffrey Hutzelman
        &lt;<a href="mailto:jhutz@cmu.edu">jhutz@cmu.edu</a>&gt;
        (until October 1, 2013)
      <li>Michael Meffie
        &lt;<a href="mmeffie@sinenomine.net">mmeffie@sinenomine.net</a>&gt;
        (until October 1, 2014)
      </ul>

    <h2>News</h2><ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://openafs2012.inf.ed.ac.uk">2012 European AFS
        and Kerberos Conference</a> will take place October 16-18 at the
      University of Edinburgh School of Informatics.  Standardization
      group chair <b>Mike Meffie</b> will give an update on the current
      state of the standardization effort and our future plans.
    </ul>

    <h2>Documents</h2>
    Section 2.3.3 of our provisional charter describes three document
    states:<dl>
      <dt>Draft</dt>
      <dd>Documents in this state are works in progress, and are
      published and distributed as Internet-Drafts.  A list of currently
      active drafts can be found in the section below.</dd>

      <dt>Experimental</dt>
      <dd>Documents in this state are generally complete specifications
      which represent the consensus of the standardization group and
      which the group considers ready for implementation and testing.
      Advancement to this state requires consensus of the group, as
      determined by the chairs following a formal last call on the
      mailing list.
      </dd>

      <dt>Standard</dt>
      <dd>Documents in this state are considered reasonably mature and
      ready for general deployment.  Before a document can advance to
      this state, it must first reach the "experimenal" state, and
      there must be at least one successful implementation of all of
      the protocol elements defined within the document.  Advancement
      then requires consensus of the group, as determined by the chairs
      following a formal last call on the mailing list.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Documents which have advanced to Experimental or Standard status
    are listed here:</p>
