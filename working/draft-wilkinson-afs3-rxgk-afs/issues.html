We have some inconsistency around the RXGK_TokenInfo structure (there are
two separate definitions!) and we say that an otherwise undefined
RXGK_Token structure is encrypted (after XDR encoding) and stored in the
encrypted_token field of the TokenContainer structure.
</td>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>
The notes that Andrew took included some uncertainty about how the
document treats the attack which having CM-specific keying material
prevents, both in the "Client Tokens" section and in the security
considerations.  Simon replied about this saying basically that he's happy
with the current text, but I don't know if Andrew et al are happy with
that.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>
We want to add some more RFC 2119 language, for frequency of the CM
renewing its token and maybe more.  We may want to remove the RFC 2119
language about removing rxkad keys from the security considerations
section, but that is not entirely clear to me.

<tr>

<td>
We should reference the VL spec (where we mention VL_RegisterAddrs).
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>
The Deason notes suggested to s/part of the RXAFS_ family/part of the
AFSINT protocol/ which did not elicit any further comment that I saw.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>
We need a better reference for extended callbacks.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>
I think Simon's reply clarified why the document forces breaking all
callbacks on SetCallbackKey, but again there was not further comment.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>
I don't think there was consensus about the generation and expiry of
extended callbacks and which channels need be rxgk-secured, and
whether/how a client could upgrade and downgrade to and from them. A
proposed text was "Only RPCs issued over an rxgk protected connection
should cause rxgk callbacks to be received"; it was also proposed that
rxgk clients might change UUID (so as to appear as a differnent client
entirely and avoid the downgrading problem).  I need to familiarize myself
more with the extended callbacks document before I can add much here.

We will need to pull in the changes we made to CombineTokens for the
AFSCombineTokens RPC.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>
We also need an AFS registry section.
