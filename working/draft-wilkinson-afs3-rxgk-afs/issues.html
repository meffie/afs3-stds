<strike>
We have some inconsistency around the RXGK_TokenInfo structure (there are
two separate definitions!) and we say that an otherwise undefined
RXGK_Token structure is encrypted (after XDR encoding) and stored in the
encrypted_token field of the TokenContainer structure.
</strike>
</td>
<td>
Fixed.
See commit bc9fb357
</td>

The notes that Andrew took included some uncertainty about how the
document treats the attack which having CM-specific keying material
prevents, both in the "Client Tokens" section and in the security
considerations.  Simon replied about this saying basically that he's happy
with the current text, but I don't know if Andrew et al are happy with
that.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>
<strike>We want to add some more RFC 2119 language, for frequency of the CM
renewing its token and maybe more.  </strike> We may want to remove the RFC 2119
language about removing rxkad keys from the security considerations
section, but that is not entirely clear to me.
</td>
<td>CM renew token text added.
Security considerations not updated.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>
We should reference the VL spec (where we mention VL_RegisterAddrs).
</td>
<td>
There is no spec that covers VL_RegisterAddrs. (VL and VVL documents
pre-date the VL_RegisterAddrs RPC.) Resolution is unclear.
</td>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>
<strike>
The Deason notes suggested to s/part of the RXAFS_ family/part of the
AFSINT protocol/ which did not elicit any further comment that I saw.
</strike>
</td>
<td>
Fixed.
See commit e2b5421a

<tr>

<td>
We need a better reference for extended callbacks.
</td>
<td>
Fixed.
See commit b7b23186
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>
I think Simon's reply clarified why the document forces breaking all
callbacks on SetCallbackKey, but again there was not further comment.
</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>
I don't think there was consensus about the generation and expiry of
extended callbacks and which channels need be rxgk-secured, and
whether/how a client could upgrade and downgrade to and from them. A
proposed text was "Only RPCs issued over an rxgk protected connection
should cause rxgk callbacks to be received"; it was also proposed that
rxgk clients might change UUID (so as to appear as a differnent client
entirely and avoid the downgrading problem).  I need to familiarize myself
more with the extended callbacks document before I can add much here.
</td>
<td>
Discussed extensively on list.
Ben proposed covering callback keying in a subsequent I-D.

<strike>
We will need to pull in the changes we made to CombineTokens for the
AFSCombineTokens RPC.
</strike>
</td>
<td>
Fixed.
See commit cfad0561

<tr>

<td>
<strike>
We also need an AFS registry section.
</strike>
</td>
<td>
Fixed.
See commit bd42b12b

<tr>

<td>
Acceptor identities for dbservers vs. fileserver/volservers
</td>
<td>
Consensus reached in discussions. Requires a small change
to the rxgk and rkgk-afs documents.
