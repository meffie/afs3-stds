Probably the biggest issue which is unaddressed is that of key rollover. 
We use the 16-bit "checksum" field of the RX header to store the key 
number, and section 8.2 ("Rekeying") currently specifies that when that 
value would overflow, the connection must be terminated.  Andrew Deason 
asked (April 2012) whether this is necessary, given that we could roll 
over the 16-bit field and still be confident about what key is in use. 
"We can be off by one or two, but we cannot be thousands off."
Hmm, Simon replied to that with some estimates of how much data can be 
safely passed through a single AES key, and seemed to think that rollover 
would be okay to add.  I don't see any other replies to that issue, so 
maybe it is less large than it first seemed, and we should just add the 
rollover provision.
</td>
<td>
Andrew suggested the key rollover should be allowed, and Ben will update
I-D to add the rollover provision.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>0.b</td>
<td>
The next biggest issue I see is that in quite a number of places, we 
specify that a random value (or nonce) should be used.  Sometimes we 
specify a length, sometimes not, but we do a bad job of justifying what a 
reasonable length is, or what level of randomness/entropic quality is 
necessary.  (E.g., how long should the client and server nonces that are 
used to generate K0 be?  Why are 20 octets enough for the RX 
challenge/response?) I will do more research on this front, but references 
and comments are welcome.
</td>
<td>
Ben will update the I-D to specify the length of the nonce, to research nonce
size justification, and add some text to the I-D regarding the nonce size.

Dave Botsch asked multiple times for description of "client" and 
"application" in the requirements language section.  I don't think this is 
usually done in this sort of document, though.

When describing security levels, do we want to make analogies to 
RPSEC_GSS security levels?
</strike>

No action required.

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>
Do we want to give upper bounds on the length of various opaques? 
(Are there security considerations to allowing these objects to grow to 
large sizes?)
</td>
<td>
Upper bounds need to be documented in the I-D.
</td>

<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>
RXGK_StartParams' description of bytelife says "establish a new 
context" which is more ambiguous than it should be.
</td>
<td>
RXGK_StartParams text needs to be clarified.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>
GSSNegotiate's description of rxgk_info should say something about not 
being defined if gss_major_status != GSS_S_COMPLETE.  I can come up with 
some wording for this.
</td>
<td>
Ben to update I-D.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>
There used to be an unused flags field in RXGK_ClientInfo that got 
removed for this revision.  Andrew Deason asked whether it's worth keeping 
the flags around for possible future use, with no response.
</td>
<td>
The flags field will be removed or it will be declared as reserved (set to all zerors).
This is intended to provide some future proofing, at a cost of 4 bytes of playload.
</td>

<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>
We may want to remind readers of the "K0" notation for the master key.
</td>
<td>
Resolution is unclear.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>
The maxcalls and call_numbers fields in RXGK_Authenticator are not 
referened elsewhere in the document, and maxcalls is redundant from 
call_numbers.  Should these be checked along with the epoch and connection 
ID when checking the response?
</td>
<td>
Resolution is unclear.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>
8.7.1's treatment of encrypt() is rather informal and short; we may 
want to give a better sketch of an algorithm to follow.
</td>
<td>
Yes, a better description needs to be provided in 8.7.1.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>
In 8.7.2 we could better describe (or have artwork for!) the 
difference between the in-memory and on-the-wire layout of the integrity 
protected packet.
</td>
<td>
Yes, 8.7.2. should have a diagram.
